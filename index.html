						I designed the Light Control Unit (LCU) for Purdue Solar Racing's 2013 car, Navitas. The LCU was designed to power the lights and control the auxiliary systems in the front and back of the car. The board was made to be flexible, the same hardware design would be used in both the back and front of the car. Constant current sources, controlled via pwm, powered the lights. Auxiliary systems like the windshield wiper, car horn, and sensors were also controlled via this board. Signals were relayed from the driver to the LCU via CAN from the Wheel Controller, but redundant hardware buttons were designed into the board in case the software solution failed during the race. I took the lessons I learned from my first embedded systems project, the Celeritas BPS, to make a much better Navitas LCU. The most notable improvement is in the use of space on the board. The schematics were drawn in OrCAD Capture, and the PCBs were designed in OrCAD Layout.

This made debugging, fixing, and replacing parts much easier across the whole project. This project was designed to be flexible enough to serve as both the front lights controller and rear lights controller. The mid lights option was to run extra LEDs for events like the homecoming parade."

It helps reduce the amount of time you spend hunting down problems and fixing things."
